msp430_dcf77_clock
==================

Home automation clock based on MSP430 launchpad with DCF77 receiver.

Done:

    - RTC clock counting time (using 32kHz quartz)
    - 16x2 LCD (4bit connection)
    - add some buttons
    - DCF77 receiver connected

Todo:

    - tune DCF77 sampling (HOLD_OVER is now useless, becouse of low freqv. stability)
    - add some outputs
